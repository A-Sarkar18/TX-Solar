      <abstract>Over 4,400 large scale commercial solar facilities are in operation in the United
        States as of December, 2021, representing over 60 gigawatts of electric power capacity; of
        these, over 3,900 are ground-mounted with capacities of 1MW or more, specified as large
        scale solar photovoltaic (LSPV) facilities. LSPV ground-mounted installations continue to
        grow, with over 400 projects coming online in 2021 alone. Currently, a comprehensive,
        publicly available georectified data describing the locations and spatial footprints of
        these facilities does not exist. Analysts from the US Geological Survey and Lawrence
        Berkeley National Laboratory collaborated to develop and release the United States Large
        Scale Solar Photovoltaic Database (USPVDB). This effort built from the expertise gained
        while developing the regularly updated United States Wind Turbine Database (USWTDB).
        Starting from Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, locations of LSPV facilities
        were visually verified using high-resolution aerial imagery; a polygon was drawn around the
        extent of facility panel arrays, and facility attributes were appended. Quality assurance
        and control were achieved via team peer review, and comparing the USPVDB to other datasets
        of US PV. The data are available in several formats, including an interactive web
        application, comma-separated value spreadsheet (CSV), application programming interface
        (API), and a shapefile. The data are available for use by academic researchers, engineers
        and developers from PV companies, government agencies, planners, educators, and the general
        public.</abstract>
      <purpose>The data release has the purpose of serving the data (that can be released to the
        public) in a way that can be machine readable. All of the data used in the larger work is
        included in tables within the report itself, this 1st version of data also serves the
        purpose of providing the information/data used in shapefile and CSV formats.</purpose>

      <attraccr>LSPV polygons were created and spatially verified in aerial imagery to confirm or
        edit their correct position. The map scale used while verifying and digitizing turbines
        depended on location, need, and imagery availability. Authors used aerial imagery with a
        typical assessment map scale of 1:2,000 to 1:5,000, none of the spatial verification was
        done at a map scale smaller than 1:5,000. Uncertainty may exist as indicated in confidence
        in site location from 1 to 4. Lower value represent a lower confidence. 1— Multiphase
        facility or multiple EIA records with identical location. Single polygon used to represent
        multiple facilities indistinguishable from one another; attributes may not reflect full
        scope of facilities. 2— Multiple polygons created, but EIA records are unclear; attributes
        may not reflect full scope of facilities. 3— Polygon reflects only a part of the facility
        due to poor image quality; area of polygon may not reflect the full size of array(s). 4—
        Facility polygons created with high confidence.</attraccr>

    <complete>Data set is considered complete for the information presented, as described in the

      data. However, we do not attempt to append additional sites not in the base EIA 860 data, due
      to our inability to compile the same level of detailed attributes (e.g., capacity, site name,

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The USPVDB dataset creation process consisted of 5 primary stages, with iterative
          troubleshooting at several locations: (1) data collection and initial screening, (2)
          georectifying facility locations, (3) digitizing facility arrays, (4) quality checking and
          review, and (5) final formatting of the data. Due to the large number of LSPV facilities
          in the US, six analysts shared the digitizing work, generally each working through one
          state's facilities at a time (and in some cases, splitting a state with a large number of
          facilities into several groups). As part of the initial screening, facilities from the EIA
          data were included if the following criteria were met: (1) generation technology is PV,
          (2) panels are ground-mounted but are not parking canopy arrays, (3) facility capacity
          greater than or equal to 1 MW, (4) facility can be identified in high-resolution imagery.
          We relied on Maxar Technologies (MT) DigitalGlobe satellite imagery to determine the
          extent of solar arrays (https://evwhs.digitalglobe.com/), due to its regularly updated
          imagery and the convenience of using an EnhancedView Web Hosting Service (EV-WHS) account
          and plug-in to use the imagery as a base layer within ArcGIS. DigitalGlobe data vary in
          resolution and frequency of imaging across the U.S. Highly populated areas tend to be
          imaged more frequently than sparsely populated rural areas, such that for some solar
          facilities, we could select the clearest image from a large set of dates when digitizing,
          while with others, we had only a single image to work from. Additionally, there is a
          temporal lag between the date a facility is operational and the most recent images in
          DigitalGlobe, ranging from several months to several years. Because of this delay in
          imaging, more recently constructed solar projects are less likely to be visible in the
          available satellite imagery.

          We recognize that there exist some number of US LSPV facilities that are not included in
          the EIA data. However, we do not here attempt to append additional sites to the EIA data
          due to our inability to compile the same level of detailed attributes (e.g., capacity,
          site name, operational date, etc.).

          In the shapefile, missing fields are denoted as 'missing' for text fields and '-9999' for
          numerical fields. In the CSV, missing values are blank. This is not to be confused with
          values that were actually marked "unknown" in the EIA data.</procdesc>

        <attrdef>The z-score of the ratio of facility capacity (in DC) and facility area
          (p_cap_dc/p_area). A z-score measures how far a record is from the mean of all records in
          the field in units of standard deviations. Records with high or low Z-scores may have an
          error in either p_cap_dc or p_area.</attrdef>
