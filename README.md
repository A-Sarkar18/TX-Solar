# TX-Solar
TX Solar MW Capacity &amp; PV Potential

## Description
I started this project, because I was interested in learning more about the dynamics surrounding Texas' reliance on Solar to prevent blackouts during Summer peak temperatures. Additionally, Texas is home to the 2nd largest Solar capacity (MW) after California. First, I wanted to map contigious US states according to their installed Solar capacity to get a general idea. I then wanted to focus in on Texas to learn more about where solar installations are located, while also visualizing Photovoltaic potential accross Texas Counties to see how the two maps compare.

## Data
I use solar installation data from Solar Energy Industries Assosciation (SEIA) to map the facilities and their corresponding size and location. I then utilize the Google Earth Engine API within Python to gather PV potential Data
